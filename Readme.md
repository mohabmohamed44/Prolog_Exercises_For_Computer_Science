## Introduction

Prolog is a logic programming language that is particularly well-suited for tasks involving rule-based logical queries such as searching, parsing, and planning. This repository showcases several Prolog applications to help you understand and explore the capabilities of the language.

## Prerequisites

To run these Prolog applications, you need to have a Prolog interpreter installed on your system. We recommend using SWI-Prolog, which is free and available for multiple platforms.

- [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mohabmohamed44/Prolog_Exercises_For_Computer_Science.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```
   cd prolog-applications
   ```

## Usage

To run a Prolog application:

1. Start the SWI-Prolog interpreter in the project directory:

   ```
   swipl
   ```

2. Load the desired application:

   ```prolog
   [app_name].
   ```

   Replace `app_name` with the name of the Prolog file you want to run.
3. Query the loaded predicates as needed.

## Applications

This repository includes the following Prolog applications:

1. **Family Tree**: Demonstrates relationships and queries in a family tree structure.
2. **Sudoku Solver**: A program that can solve Sudoku puzzles using constraint logic programming.
3. **Expert System**: A simple expert system for diagnosing computer problems.
4. **Natural Language Parser**: A basic natural language parser for simple English sentences.

Each application is contained in its own `.pl` file with accompanying documentation and example queries.
